If you enjoyed the electronic edition of Little Brother and you want to donate 
something to say thanks, go to http://craphound.com/littlebrother/donate/ and 
find a teacher or librarian you want to support.  Then go to Amazon, BN.com, 
or your favorite electronic bookseller and order a copy to the classroom, 
then email a copy of the receipt (feel free to delete your address and other 
personal info first!) to freelittlebrother@gmail.com so that Olga can mark 
that copy as sent.  If you don't want to be publicly acknowledged for your 
generosity, let us know and we'll keep you anonymous, otherwise we'll thank 
you on the donate page.

<p>	A message from Cory Doctorow:
</p>
<p>	Every time I put a book online for free, I get emails from readers who 
	want to send me donations for the book. I appreciate their generous
	spirit, but I'm not interested in cash donations, because my
	publishers are really important to me. They contribute immeasurably
	to the book, improving it, introducing it to an audience I could never
	reach, helping me do more with my work. I have no desire to cut them
	out of the loop.
</p>

<p>	But there has to be some good way to turn that generosity to good use,
	and I think I've found it.
</p>

<p>	Here's the deal: there are lots of teachers and librarians who'd love to 
	get hard-copies of Little Brother into their kids' hands, but don't have the
	budget for it (teachers in the US spend around $1,200 out of pocket
	each on classroom supplies that their budgets won't stretch to cover,
	which is why I sponsor a classroom at Ivanhoe Elementary in my old
	neighborhood in Los Angeles; you can adopt a class yourself 
	<a href="http://www.adoptaclassroom.org/">here</a>).
</p>

<p>	There are generous people who want to send some cash my way to thank me 
	for the free ebooks.
</p>

<p>	I'm proposing that we put them together. 
</p>

<p>	If you're a teacher or librarian and you want a free copy of Little
	Brother, email 
	<a href="mailto:freelittlebrother@gmail.com">freelittlebrother@gmail.com</a> 
	with your name and the name and address of your school. It'll be 
	<a href="http://craphound.com/littlebrother/donate/">posted to my site</a> 
	by my fantastic helper, Olga Nunes, so that potential donors can see it.
</p>

<p>	If you enjoyed the electronic edition of Little Brother and you want to
	donate something to say thanks, 
	<a href="http://craphound.com/littlebrother/donate/">go here</a> 
	and find a teacher or librarian you want to support. Then go to Amazon, 
	BN.com, or your favorite electronic bookseller and order a copy to the
	classroom, then email a copy of the receipt (feel free to delete your
	address and other personal info first!) to
	<a href="mailto:freelittlebrother@gmail.com">freelittlebrother@gmail.com</a> 
	so that Olga can mark that copy as sent. If you don't want to be publicly 
	acknowledged for your generosity, let us know and we'll keep you 
	anonymous, otherwise we'll thank you on the donate page.
</p>

<p>	I have no idea if this will end up with hundreds, dozens or just a few
	copies going out -- but I have high hopes!
