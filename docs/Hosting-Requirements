ShinyCMS - Hosting Requirements
===============================

ShinyCMS is a web application, to install it you will need web hosting with 
the following features*:

Operating system: Linux
Database server:  MySQL 5.x
Web server:       Apache 2.x

For production use you will need an appropriately-configured persistent Perl 
environment for Apache - preferably FastCGI, although mod_perl should also 
work.

You will also need to install a large number of Perl modules - mostly related 
to the Catalyst framework, but also some used for RSS/Atom generation and 
parsing, email sending, and other useful tasks.  You can see the full list 
in Makefile.PL - they are all standard modules available from CPAN.

ShinyCMS should work with all Perl versions from 5.10.1 on:

* The Catalyst framework theoretically supports web applications being 
redeployed under alternative operating systems / database servers / 
web servers to those described above.  If you have success installing 
ShinyCMS in alternative environments please let us know so that we can 
update this documentation accordingly.
