ShinyCMS Changes
================

This file vaguely documents the revision history for ShinyCMS.  Newest items 
are at the top.

2019-07-10 (v19.7)
	- BREAKING CHANGES:
		- Refactored code for updating mailing list subscriptions.
			- No database changes, but HTML, TT, and Controller all changed.
			- If you haven't edited root/newsletters/lists.tt for your site
			  then you just need to replace it with the new one at the same
			  time as you replace lib/ShinyCMS/Controllers/Newsletters.pm. If
			  you have edited the template then then you need to port your HTML
			  changes into the new template, or port the new TT code into your
			  modified template, before updating the controller.
			- There is some new CSS to support the default/demo site templates
			  for the subscriptions page.
		- Refactored blog and news controllers and templates to use built-in
		  DBIC pager rather than the previous hand-rolled approach
		    - You will need to update your templates to incorporate the new TT
		      code, or vice versa, at the same time as updating the controllers
		- There are a few other CSS changes for pages other than the
		  mailing list subscriptions page.
		- The main.css file has also been re-ordered, so it may be hard to pick
		  out the changes in this release - sorry! Hopefully the new order will
		  make this easier in future though.
		- The config variable name for how many items to display on a page on
		  the main site has been changed (from a few different variable names,
		  but mostly posts_per_page or items_per_page) to be page_size
		  everywhere - this is now consistent with the controllers and config
		  for the admin area. A new top-level config item has been added for
		  setting the default, which can then be overridden on a per-controller
		  basis as desired. Your config file will very probably need updating
		  if/when you update any of the main site controllers.
		- In general, various new config options have been added in the last
		  few months. The config file has also been re-organised so it will
		  unfortunately be hard to get a useful diff against your existing
		  config. Make a fresh copy of the default file and edit your site's
		  config back into it to make sure you get all the new stuff!
	- ALSO IMPORTANT
		- If you are using the CCBill access subscription payment handler,
		  please test it thoroughly after updating it, as it did get refactored
		  to support more thorough testing (coverage is now 100%!). I'm fairly
		  sure that there were no changes to existing functionality (other than
		  returning more useful errors in a few places) but obviously your
		  income stream is worth triple-checking.
		    - This handler now attempts to fall back to matching on user email
			  address if CCBill don't round-trip the shinycms_username properly
	- Other stuff
		- The main focus since the 19.6 release last month has continued to be
		  extending test coverage - particularly for the Admin controllers. The
		  coverage on roughly half of these is now 100%, along with two of the
		  simpler non-admin controllers, the Access payment handler as mentioned
		  above, and all of the DBIx::Class model and schema result files.
		- There has been some refactoring to support easier/better/more thorough
		  testing, but most of it should have no impact on functionality.
		  Replacing the admin area in one hit rather than piecemeal is probably
		  sensible though - as mentioned previously there's a utility script
		  which may help you with that process: bin/dev-tools/replace-admin-area
		- All tests should now 'tidy up' after themselves, so that each set of
		  tests, and the test suite as a whole, can be re-run without resetting
		  the database in-between test runs (as long as the tests don't die
		  before finishing).

2019-06-09 (v19.6)
	- POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGES:
		- Moved admin controller minimum authorisation checks into base methods
			- This means e.g. Page Admins must _also_ have Page Editor role now
		- Added two new roles:
			- Fileserver Admin
			- Shared Content Admin
		- Added top-level page_size setting for admin area to 
		  config/shinycms.conf
	- Added an install.sh script that can be used for one-liner installs
	- Added poll admin area
	- Added delete feature to shared content area
	- Lots of work on tests
		- Added test coverage analysis via Devel::Cover
		- Added test_requires section in Makefile.PL
		- Fixed CircleCI config to use caching properly
		- Updated CircleCI config to report coverage data to codecov
		- Updated Travis CI config to report coverage data to codecov
		- Doubled test coverage - from just under 30%, to almost 60%
		- Changed the scripts that insert the demo site data so that they can
		  be re-run without duplicating (or triplicating, etc) the demo data
		- Added more demo data for News section and for Fileserver features
		- Various utility scripts for running tests
		- Added test database config, invoked with SHINYCMS_TEST=1 env var
		- Added CircleCI, Travis CI, and Codecov badges to README
	- Created helper libs for tests and utility scripts, to make sure they're
	  all using the right config and connecting to the right database etc
	- Rearranged code in controllers to be more consistent, moving
	  private/utility methods to the end of the file
	- Started updating admin controller URLs to be a bit more consistent;
	  in particular, various '/edit-[thing]-do' URLs have become '/thing/save'
	- Moved static resources for admin area into one sub-folder, for easier
	  updating (and added a utility script to update the admin area)
	- Stopped explicitly setting wrapper in main site templates
	  (select-wrapper.tt sets it for both admin and main site now)
	- Removed PHP examples from CKEditor code, to stop GitHub mentioning PHP
	- Lots of whitespace changes; sorry about that  :)

2019-05-04 (v19.5)
	- Version number bumped to use the 'Ubuntu' style (19.5 for May 2019)
	- Rather large gap since this file was last updated  :)
	- Over the last month the admin area and the default/demo site have 
	  both been re-styled, using modern HTML5 templates provided by 
	  open-source projects (thank you, CoreUI and html5up!)
	- License changed to 'the same terms as Perl itself', i.e. your 
	  choice of GPL v2 or The Artistic License.  Both licenses have 
	  been added to the docs folder, and the AGPL has been removed.
